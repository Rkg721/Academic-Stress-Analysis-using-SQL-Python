# Academic-Stress-Analysis-using-SQL-Python

# ðŸ“Š Academic Stress Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes academic stress factors among students using a dataset that includes gender, study hours, sleep hours, exam scores, and self-reported stress levels.

## Deliverables
1. **Jupyter Notebook (`Academic_Stress_Analysis.ipynb`)** â€“ Data exploration, visualization, and SQL integration.
2. **SQL Script (`Academic_Stress_Analysis.sql`)** â€“ Database schema and analysis queries.
3. **PDF Report (`Academic_Stress_Report.pdf`)** â€“ Executive summary, key insights, and visualizations.
4. **README.md** â€“ Project overview and execution guide.

## How to Run
1. Import the SQL script into MySQL/SQLite to create the database.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore data, execute queries, and visualize insights.
3. Review the PDF report for a management-friendly summary.

## Key Insights
- Stress levels are **higher among students with fewer sleep hours**.
- **Study hours** correlate positively with **exam scores** but also contribute to stress if excessive.
- Gender differences in stress perception are visible but not extreme.

## Future Enhancements
- Apply Machine Learning models to predict stress levels.
- Expand dataset for cross-country comparisons.
- Automate dashboard creation using Power BI/Tableau.
